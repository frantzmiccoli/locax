Analyze location history to detect crossings.

Google and perhaps other service providers enable the recuperation of what they
recorded of your location history. If you want do get your data, they are
available on Google Takeout: https://takeout.google.com/

In the context of Coronavirus, but somehow any disease spreading from human
to human, seeing which patient have crossed path with which other patient could
help to understand how the disease spread.

To be fully honest though I am not sure this project has any scientific
relevancy or medical relevancy.

I am just doing for fun and to try to live stream the whole process.

First session, 22nd March 2020: project overview, project setup and
first simulation code  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzXzaLLXWAA


Second session, 29th March 2020: unit test, debugging and making more
realistic daily trips

Third session will be about: writing our fake data in JSON files, and
loading them in another part of the project (map visualization).
5th April at 17h CEST https://youtu.be/vBDytVu97l0

Fourth session will be about: visualizing multiple person data on our
map, maybe a bit of refactoring to keep things maintainable and
algorithmic analysis of people crossing path. Likely 12th April 17h CEST
maybe on Twitch this time.

Nothing fancy, just writing code.
