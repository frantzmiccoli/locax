Analyze location history to detect crossings.

Google and perhaps other service providers enable the recuperation of what they
recorded of your location history. If you want do get your data, they are
available on Google Takeout: https://takeout.google.com/

In the context of Coronavirus, but somehow any disease spreading from human
to human, seeing which patient have crossed path with which other patient could
help to understand how the disease spread.

To be fully honest though I am not sure this project has any scientific
relevancy or medical relevancy.

I am just doing for fun and to try to live stream the whole process.

Live stream
===

First live stream will be done at 20h30 CET on the 22nd March. I will share
the link on https://twitter.com/frantzmiccoli

Target of this first live stream: inspect Google Location history,
generate fake data to be able to work on the problem, visualize those locations
histories on some map.

Nothing fancy, just writing code.
